AspectType Aspect types can be used to centrally define the structure of aspects.

Solution: To remove sources of uncertainty, delete, if possible, any synchronizations started for attributes, assets or aspects. If the connection fails only after the synchronization of an element has been started, check the next question in this section. If the connection cannot be established to the broker even if no synchronization of an element to this broker has been started, the issue might be related to the configuration of the broker parameters or authentication. A wrong configuration of the following parameters will not allow a successful connection to the broker:</p> <ul> <li> <p>MQTT Protocol This defines the protocol to be used when establishing the broker connection. Check that the right protocol is chosen for establishing the connection. More information can be found in Setting up a generic MQTT broker as a synchronization destination.</p> </li> <li> <p>MQTT Host Write the host name without any protocol, colon or port number. The protocol, colon and port number will be added internally. For instance, to synchronize data to: <code>ssl://b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:61617</code>, the following values should be chosen:  </p> <ul> <li>MQTT Protocol: <code>SSL/TLS/MQTTS</code></li> <li>MQTT Host: <code>b-1234a5b6-78cd-901e-2fgh-3i45j6k178l9-1.mq.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code></li> <li>MQTT Port: <code>61617</code></li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>MQTT Port Make sure to only write the port number here, without any colon or slash. Open this port in the proxy settings of the Industrial Edge Device or firewall to allow communication to the MQTT broker.</p> </li> <li>MQTT Authentication Method If the wrong credentials or certificates are uploaded to IIH Essentials a connection will not be established to the broker. Please make sure that the correct credentials and/or certificates are used, in case they are needed.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Issue: The connection to the broker was successfully established but it disconnected as soon as the synchronization for an attribute, asset or aspect was started. Solution: If the connection fails after the synchronization of an element has been started, it means that the issue is related to the outgoing data rather than to the authentication or MQTT protocol. In this case it, double-check if the broker has any specific requirements or limitations for receiving payloads. The following parameters could terminate the connection, if not configured as allowed by the broker:</p> <ul> <li>Retained flag Some brokers might not allow sent messages to be retained. Make sure that the broker allows for receiving messages with a retained flag before activating it.</li> <li>Maximum MQTT packages per second The broker might limit the amount of packages that can be received within a second to avoid a system overload. Check this value before configuring the synchronization.</li> <li>Maximum MQTT package size If not correctly configured, IIH Essentials might create MQTT packages larger than those allowed by the broker. If a smaller package size is chosen, data is not thrown away but split into smaller packages.</li> <li>QoS (Quality of service) Check if the chosen QoS when configuring the data destination is allowed in the MQTT broker.</li> <li>Message publishing interval The broker might limit the frequency at which packages can be published to avoid a system overload. Check this value before configuring the synchronization.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Issue: The connection to the broker was successfully established, it remains connected when the synchronization for an attribute, asset or aspect has been started but cannot see any incoming data in the MQTT broker. Solution: If no error is being shown but still no data is being received in the broker, check the following:</p> <ul> <li>Hierarchy has at least one attribute To start receiving data, at least one attribute must be included as part of the hierarchy to be synchronized. Assets and aspects cannot hold data on their own, they can hold attributes where the data can be stored.</li> <li> <p>Attribute has data After making sure that the hierarchy contains at least one attribute, check if the attribute has already been mapped to receive and store data.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the aim is synchronizing new incoming data, make sure that the attribute is receiving data, this can be for instance checked in the IIH Essentials UI with the value tab: Live value of an attribute</p> </li> <li> <p>If the aim is synchronizing historic data only, also make sure that the data of the attribute has a time stamp later than the start time of the synchronization. As an illustration, if an attribute has data from <code>2025-01-01 at 13:52:20.000</code> until <code>2025-01-22 at 01:01:30.000</code>, and the start date for the synchronization is <code>2025-01-22 at 11:03:34.000</code> or any time in the future, no data will be sent out to the broker because the start date of the synchronization is outside of the range where the attribute has data.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Topic in configuration file is correct Make sure that the topic is configured as expected. If the path or attribute name has spaces, these will be removed from the topic. See Creating a configuration file for more details on how to define the topic in the configuration file. For troubleshooting, a simple topic can be configured in the configuration file to remove sources of uncertainty and check if data arrives to the test topic, for instance: <code>\"topic\": \"testTopic\"</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"working-with-data/synchronizing-data/setting-up-destination/generic-mqtt/creating-a-config-file.html","title":"Creating a configuration file","text":"<p>A JSON configuration file is required to synchronize data to a generic MQTT broker.
