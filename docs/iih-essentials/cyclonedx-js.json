The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

              "content": "A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible? (1)\n\n    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

License Grants and Conditions\n\n2.1. Grants\n\n     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n     non-exclusive license:\n\n     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as\n        part of a Larger Work; and\n\n     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for\n        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions\n        or its Contributor Version.\n\n2.2. Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\n     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\n     such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n        Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n     under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not\n      distributed with this file, You can\n      obtain one at\n      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then\nYou may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant\ndirectory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible\n      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by\n      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.\n\n"

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"

Contributor Grant.\n     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\n     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n\n          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\n          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an\n          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code\n          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\n          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\n          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions\n          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have\n          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that\n          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of\n          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor\n          Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are\n          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of\n          the Covered Code.\n\n          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;\n          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of\n          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made\n          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the\n          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\n          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\n          that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License.\n     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n               (c)    Representations.\n          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n          this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n     terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n     Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\n     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n     this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n     shall survive.\n\n     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n     Participant.\n\n     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n     license.\n\n     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n     rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n     License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n     \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\n     Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\n     compliance with the License.
